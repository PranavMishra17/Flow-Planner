I can see there's a search input field in the browser state. The search input is inside a shadow DOM element (marked as |SHADOW(open)|) with ID \"searchInput\". I should:\n   - Input \"Quantum mechanics\" into the search field\n   - Submit the search\n\n5. **Action Plan**: I'll input \"Quantum mechanics\" into the search field and then click the submit button to search. The search input is at index [4] (inside shadow DOM) and the submit button is at index [541].\n\nNote: The user wrote \"Quantam\" but likely meant \"Quantum\" - I'll use the correct spelling \"Quantum mechanics\" for the search.\n"
