This suggests the page is either still loading (SPA not fully loaded) or I'm at a landing page that requires interaction.\n\n3. **User Request Analysis**: I need to follow a specific workflow:\n   - Navigate to Linear (DONE - already at https://linear.app)\n   - Authenticate using GitHub or Google\n   - Navigate to team/project workspace\n   - Create a new issue (bug report)\n   - Fill in required fields\n   - Assign metadata\n   - Submit the issue\n\n4. **Current State Assessment**: The page shows minimal content - just an SVG logo. This is likely either:\n   - The page is still loading (SPA needs time)\n   - This is a landing page that needs interaction\n   - I need to wait for the page to fully load\n\n5. **Screenshot Analysis**: I can see the screenshot shows a very minimal page with just the Linear logo visible. This confirms the page might still be loading or this is an initial landing page.\n\n6. **Next Action**: Since this appears to be an SPA (Single Page Application) that hasn't fully loaded yet, I should wait a few seconds for the page to fully render before proceeding. After waiting, I'll likely see login/authentication options or the main Linear interface.\n\n7. **Memory**: This is my first step, I'm at the Linear landing page, and I need to wait for the page to fully load before I can proceed with authentication.\n"
