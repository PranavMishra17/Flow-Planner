The page might still be loading, or the JavaScript hasn't fully initialized yet. I need to wait for the page to fully load before I can interact with it.\n\n4. **User Request Analysis**: \n   - The task is to share a YouTube video on SpaceX\n   - I need to follow the workflow: Navigate → Search → Select video → Share → Copy link\n   - Currently at step 1 (Navigate to YouTube homepage)\n   - The instructions emphasize taking time to ensure each action succeeds before moving to the next\n\n5. **Next Action**: Since the page appears empty but I can see there's content (2.5 pages below), I should wait for the page to fully load. YouTube is a heavy SPA that takes time to initialize. I'll wait a few seconds for the page to load properly.\n\n6. **Memory**: This is step 1 - just navigated to YouTube homepage, waiting for page to load.\n"

However, I could also choose the official SpaceX channel video or the Bloomberg Technology video about SpaceX catching a rocket.\n\nLet me choose the \"SpaceX Makes History Catching Rocket on Landing\" video from Bloomberg Technology as it's a well-known, verified source with high views (1.3M) and represents a significant SpaceX achievement. The video link is at index 13665.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, I should choose a video that's clearly a SpaceX video. The \"SpaceX Reveals Starship HLS Prototype Interior!\" video at index 13569 seems like a good choice, or I could go with one of the first results. Let me click on the first major video result: \"China Made Itself a Joke with the New SpaceX Starship Raptor 3's Copycat…Elon Musk laugh!\" at index 12108.\n\nWait, that title seems a bit clickbait-y. Let me choose a more official-looking video. The \"SpaceX Makes History Catching Rocket on Landing\" from Bloomberg Technology (verified channel) at index 13665 would be a better choice as it's from a reputable news source.\n"

In the last step, I waited 3 seconds for the modal to fully load.\n\n2. **Current State Verification**: Looking at the browser_state, I can now see the share modal is fully loaded with many new interactive elements marked with asterisks (*).

I can see the share URL input field and the Copy button clearly displayed.\n\n4. **Success Evaluation**: The wait action was successful - the share modal is now fully loaded with all sharing options visible. Verdict: Success\n\n5. **User Request Analysis**: The user wants to \"Share a youtube video on SpaceX\".

This will complete the sharing workflow as requested.\n\n7. **Task Completion**: After clicking Copy, I should call the done action to report success and provide the video link to the user.\n"
