This appears to be a form/database view already. However, I need to verify if this is a database view where I can demonstrate filtering.\n\n4. **Browser State Analysis**: \n   - I can see tabs: \"Form builder\" (selected) and \"Responses\"\n   - There's a sidebar with pages: \"My Note\", \"Getting Started\", \"To Do List\"\n   - The current page seems to be a form builder interface\n   - I can see buttons for \"Preview\", \"Share form\", \"Edit form, add questions and more...\"\n\n5. **Next Steps**: Since I'm already in a Notion workspace and on what appears to be a database/form view, I should:\n   - First, I need to check if this is actually a database view where I can demonstrate filtering\n   - Look for database views in the sidebar (like \"To Do List\" which might be a database)\n   - Or check if the current \"Responses\" tab shows a database view where I can apply filters\n\n6. **Strategy**: Let me click on the \"Responses\" tab to see if that shows a database view where I can demonstrate filtering. If not, I'll navigate to one of the other pages in the sidebar that might be a database.\n\nSince this is the first step, I should also create a todo.md file to track the workflow steps.\n"

Select a Property:**\\n   - Click to see a dropdown list of all available properties in your database\\n   - Choose the property you want to filter by (e.g., \"Item Name\", \"Respondent\", \"Submission time\")\\n   - In this demonstration, I selected \"Item Name\"\\n   \\n   **b. Choose a Condition:**\\n   - After selecting a property, choose the filtering condition\\n   - Available conditions depend on the property type:\\n     - Text properties: contains, does not contain, is, is not, starts with, ends with, is empty, is not empty\\n     - Number properties: =, ≠, >, <, ≥, ≤, is empty, is not empty\\n     - Date properties: is, is before, is after, is on or before, is on or after, is within, is empty, is not empty\\n     - Select/Multi-select: is, is not, contains, does not contain, is empty, is not empty\\n   - I used the \"contains\" condition for the text property\\n   \\n   **c.
