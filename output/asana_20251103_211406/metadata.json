There are 25 interactive elements, but they are all just generic `<div>` elements without descriptive text. The main content area is marked with `[158]<main id=asana_main_page />`.\n\n3. **Screenshot Analysis**: I need to take a screenshot to see what's actually on the page. The browser state shows interactive elements but no text labels, which means I need visual confirmation to understand what's displayed - whether it's a login page, the main Asana interface, or something else.\n\n4. **User Request**: I need to add a task \"Goto football practice\" to Asana. The workflow involves:\n   - Navigate to Asana (done)\n   - Authenticate if needed\n   - Find the Create Task button\n   - Input the task name\n   - Submit\n\n5. **Current Goal**: Since I can't determine from the browser state alone what's on the page (login screen vs main interface), I should take a screenshot to see the actual state of the page and determine the next action.\n\nThis is the first real step where I need to assess what's on screen before proceeding.\n"
