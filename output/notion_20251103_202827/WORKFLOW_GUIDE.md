# Workflow Guide: Creating and Configuring a Shopping List Form in Notion

This guide details the complete process for a new user or agent to create a new page/form in Notion, rename it to "Shopping List," and populate it with structure suitable for tracking household items.

**Total Steps Documented:** 14 Key Steps (from 20 total executed steps)

## 1. Initial Setup and Navigation

The process begins by navigating to the Notion homepage. Assuming you are already authenticated into your workspace (as indicated by the logged-in state in the workflow).

### Step 1: Navigate to Notion Homepage
*   **Action:** Navigate to the Notion official URL.
*   **URL:** \`https://www.notion.so\`
*   **Screenshot:** `![Step 1](step_001.png)`
*   **What's Happening:** The browser loads the main Notion interface. Since the agent was already logged in, the starting page is visible (in this case, a page named "My New Note").

## 2. Creating the Form Structure

The next critical step is invoking the command to create a new Form block within the current Notion page.

### Step 2: Select the 'Form' Option
*   **Action:** Locate and click the "Form" option within the "Get started with" menu displayed on the page.
*   **URL:** \`https://www.notion.so\`

## 3. Renaming the Form

Immediately after creation, the form must be renamed according to the requirements.

### Step 3: Rename the Form to 'Shopping List'
*   **Action:** Click on the default Form Title placeholder (index 1274) and input the required name: "Shopping List".

*   **Screenshot:** `![Step 5](step_005.png)`
