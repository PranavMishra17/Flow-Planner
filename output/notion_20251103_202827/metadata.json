Looking at the current structure, I have two default questions. I should:\n   - Modify Question 1 to be something like \"Item Name\" or \"Household Item\"\n   - Modify Question 2 or add more questions for other relevant fields like \"Quantity\", \"Category\", etc.\n   - Or I could add multiple questions, each representing a household item\n\nActually, thinking about this more carefully - the user wants to add \"items for household use\" to a shopping list. This could mean:\n- Option A: Create form fields to collect shopping list items (like \"Item Name\", \"Quantity\", \"Category\")\n- Option B: Pre-populate the form with specific household items\n\nGiven the context of a \"Shopping List\" form, Option A makes more sense - creating fields that can be used to add household items. However, the user said \"add items for household use\", which suggests they want actual items listed.\n\nLet me reconsider: In Notion, a form is typically used to collect responses. But for a shopping list, the user likely wants a list of actual items. The form structure might not be the best approach here. However, since we've already created a form, I should work with it.\n\nI think the best approach is to:\n1. Rename Question 1 to \"Item Name\" \n2. Rename Question 2 to \"Quantity\" or \"Category\"\n3. Add more questions if needed for household items\n\nOr, I could add specific household items as options in Question 2 if it's a multiple choice question.\n\nLooking at the browser state, Question 2 has options (I can see \"Add option\" button and input fields). This suggests it's a multiple choice or select question. I could add household items as options here.\n\nLet me start by clicking on Question 1 to rename it to something more appropriate for a shopping list.\n"
