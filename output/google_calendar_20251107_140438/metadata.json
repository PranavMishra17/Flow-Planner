The agent history shows the action was executed, but the calendar grid still shows \"(No title)\" for the event being created. I then requested a screenshot to verify the state.\n\n2. **Current State Analysis from Screenshot and Browser State**:\n   - Looking at the browser state, I can see the event creation form is open on the right side\n   - There's a shadow DOM input field: `|SHADOW(open)|[2885]<input type=text id=c116 aria-label=Add title placeholder=Add title autocomplete=off />`\n   - The calendar grid shows: \"1am to 2am, No title, Kenz 17, Accepted, No location, 7 November 2025 Event is being created.\"\n   - The form shows date/time as \"Friday, 7 November, 1:00am, 2:00am\"\n   - There are buttons for adding guests, Google Meet, location, description\n   - There's a \"Save\" button at the bottom\n\n3. **Evaluation of Previous Action**: The title input appears to be in a shadow DOM element. The text \"Team Meeting\" may not have been successfully entered since the calendar still shows \"(No title)\". Looking at the screenshot would help verify, but based on the browser state showing \"(No title)\", the input likely failed or wasn't properly committed. Verdict: Uncertain/Likely Failed\n\n4. **Current Goal**: I need to verify if the title was entered. Looking at the browser state, the input field is in a shadow DOM (index 2885). I should try inputting the title again into this specific shadow DOM input field. After that, I need to demonstrate:\n   - Adjusting the time\n   - Adding guests\n   - Adding location/description\n   - Saving the event\n\n5. **Next Action**: I should input \"Team Meeting\" into the shadow DOM input field (index 2885), then proceed to demonstrate other features like adjusting time and adding guests before saving.\n\nSince this is a demonstration task, I should show the complete workflow including:\n- Title input (retry)\n- Time adjustment\n- Adding guests\n- Saving the event\n\nLet me input the title into the shadow DOM input field first.\n"
