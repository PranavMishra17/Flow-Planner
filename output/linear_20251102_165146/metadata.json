The system returned an error about \"Invalid model output format\" but this appears to be a system error, not a failure of the action itself.\n\n2. **Current Browser State Analysis**: Looking at the browser state, I can now see:\n   - URL is still at https://linear.app/firstone17/projects/all\n   - There are now TWO projects visible:\n     1. \"Q4 Product Launch\" (existing project)\n     2. \"Website Redesign Project\" (NEW project - the one I just created!)\n   \n   The new project \"Website Redesign Project\" is visible at index 4039 with:\n   - No updates\n   - No Priority\n   - No lead\n   - No target date\n   - 0% completion\n\n3. **Success Verification**: The project creation was SUCCESSFUL! The \"Website Redesign Project\" now appears in the projects list alongside the existing \"Q4 Product Launch\" project. The form has closed and we're back to the projects list view.\n\n4. **Task Completion Check**: Looking at the user request workflow:\n   ✅ 1. Navigate to the Linear application URL - Done\n   ✅ 2. Authenticate using the primary method - Already authenticated\n   ✅ 3. Navigate to the workspace/team view - Done\n   ✅ 4. Locate the option to create a new project - Done\n   ✅ 5. Input the required project details (name, description, etc.) - Done\n   ✅ 6. Configure project settings - Done (used defaults)\n   ✅ 7. Finalize and create the project - Done\n\nAll steps in the workflow have been completed successfully. The project \"Website Redesign Project\" with the summary \"Complete overhaul of company website with modern design and improved UX\" has been created and is now visible in the Linear workspace.\n\n5. **Next Action**: Since the task is complete, I should call the `done` action to report success to the user.\n"
