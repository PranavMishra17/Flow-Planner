I can see:\n   - The task name \"Schedule kickoff meeting\" at the top\n   - Assignee: Pranav\n   - Due date: Nov 3 - 5\n   - Projects section showing \"Cross-functional project plan\" with a dropdown showing \"To do\"\n   - Priority: Medium\n   - Status: At risk\n   - Description field\n   - Comments section at the bottom\n\n4. **Next Action**: I need to click on the dropdown button (element *[3039]) that currently shows \"To do\" to change it to \"Doing\" (which is the \"In Progress\" section in this board). This is the key action to demonstrate how to move a task from \"To do\" to \"In Progress\".\n\n5. **Progress Tracking**: I should update the todo.md file to mark that I've accessed the task details and am now ready to change the status.\n\nThe workflow is clear:\n- Click on the \"To do\" dropdown in the Projects section\n- Select \"Doing\" from the dropdown options\n- Verify the change is reflected in the board view\n"

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n## Method: Using Board View with Task Details Panel\n\n### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project\n- Go to https://app.asana.com\n- Select the project containing your tasks (in this demo: \"Cross-functional project plan\")\n- Ensure you're in **Board view** (you can also use List view, but Board view is most visual)\n\n### Step 2: Locate the Task in 'To Do' Section\n- On the Board view, you'll see columns representing different statuses/sections\n- In this demo, the board had three sections:\n  - **To do** (2 tasks initially)\n  - **Doing** (1 task initially)\n  - **Done** (0 tasks initially)\n- Identified the task: \"Schedule kickoff meeting\" in the \"To do\" column\n\n### Step 3: Open Task Details\n- Click on the task card to open the task details panel on the right side\n- The panel displays all task information including description, assignee, due date, and importantly, the **section/status field**\n\n### Step 4: Change the Section/Status\n- In the task details panel, look for the **Projects** section\n- You'll see a dropdown button showing the current section (\"To do\")\n- Click on this dropdown button to open the section selector\n- A menu appears with all available sections:\n  - To do (currently selected)\n  - Doing\n  - Done\n\n### Step 5: Select 'In Progress' Status\n- Click on **\"Doing\"** (which represents 'In Progress' status)\n- The task immediately moves to the \"Doing\" section\n- The dropdown now shows \"Doing\" as the selected section\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Change\n- Close the task details panel (click the X button or click outside)\n- The board now shows:\n  - **To do**: 1 task (\"Share timeline with teammates\")\n  - **Doing**: 2 tasks (\"Schedule kickoff meeting\" + \"Draft project brief\")\n  - **Done**: 0 tasks\n- The task card for \"Schedule kickoff meeting\" is now visually in the \"Doing\" column\n\n## Alternative Method: Drag and Drop\nAsana also supports drag-and-drop functionality in Board view:\n- Simply click and hold a task card\n- Drag it to the desired column (e.g., from \"To do\" to \"Doing\")\n- Release to drop it in the new section\n\n## Key Points:\n- **Section names may vary**: Your project might use different names like \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", \"Complete\" or custom names\n- **Board vs List view**: Both views allow status changes, but Board view is more visual and intuitive\n- **Immediate update**: Changes are saved automatically and reflected instantly\n- **Custom fields**: Some projects use custom status fields instead of sections - the process is similar but you'd change a \"Status\" custom field instead\n\n## Result:\n✅ Successfully moved \"Schedule kickoff meeting\" from 'To Do' to 'In Progress' (Doing)\n✅ Change verified on the board view\n✅ Task count updated: To do (1), Doing (2), Done (0)",
