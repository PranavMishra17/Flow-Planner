Click the link to the 'Elon Musk' article\n\n- This is a step-by-step instruction type task, so I need to follow each step precisely\n- The page is currently empty, so my first action should be to navigate to the Wikipedia URL\n\nSince this is a straightforward task with clear steps, I don't need to create a todo.md file (the task is less than 10 steps as per file_system rules).\n\nNext Action:\nI should navigate to https://www.wikipedia.org as instructed in the user request.\n"
