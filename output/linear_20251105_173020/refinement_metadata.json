The screenshot clearly shows the confirmation modal in the bottom right corner (Cell (3,3)) containing the text 'Deleted Kwame' and information about restoration. Although the modal that appeared immediately after the previous click (which the context describes as having 'Cancel' and 'Delete' buttons) is no longer present in this view (it might have been closed, or this view is showing a toast notification instead), the overall goal of deleting the project is reflected by the 'Deleted Kwame' banner in cell (3,3). Since the previous step successfully opened the modal, and the memory indicates readiness to click 'Delete', this screenshot seems to be taken *after* the deletion attempt or while viewing the confirmation/result. However, based on the previous action, we were expecting to click 'Delete'. The screenshot shows a 'Deleted Kwame' banner in (3,3). Assuming the execution flowed to the next logical step (confirming deletion or seeing the result), the crucial UI element (the confirmation modal) that should be visible is replaced by a 'Deleted' notification. Since the *action* was to click 'Delete', and the current state shows 'Deleted Kwame' in (3,3), the step is valid in the sense that the context relates to the deletion process, but the expected 'Delete' button is not present; instead, a success confirmation banner is visible. Given the memory/next goal was to click 'Delete', and the screenshot shows the *result* of deletion ('Deleted Kwame' banner), I will mark it as valid but refine the description to focus on where the confirmation/result is visible, as the intended action (clicking Delete) might have just completed before this capture, leading to the banner. The banner itself is in cell (3,3), context around it includes the Download Linear banner above it (2,3) and surrounding screen elements.",
