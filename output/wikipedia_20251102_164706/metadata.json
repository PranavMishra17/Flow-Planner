I've successfully navigated to Wikipedia (this was done automatically). Now I need to proceed with the search workflow.\n\n5. **Next Action**: According to the workflow:\n   - Step 1: Navigate to Wikipedia homepage ✓ (Done)\n   - Step 2: Locate the search input field ✓ (Found - it's element [4] inside shadow DOM)\n   - Step 3: Enter the search query 'Machine Learning' (Next action)\n   - Step 4: Submit the search query\n   - Step 5: Identify the first search result link\n   - Step 6: Click the link to access the article\n\n6. **Action Plan**: I need to:\n   - Input \"Machine Learning\" into the search field (element [4])\n   - Click the submit button (element [543]) or press Enter\n\nSince the input field is inside a shadow DOM, I can still interact with it using the index [4]. I'll input the text and then submit the form. I can do both actions in sequence for efficiency.\n"

Wikipedia's search often redirects directly to an article when there's an exact or very close match, which is what happened here.\n\n4. **User Request Analysis**: The user asked me to:\n   - Search for 'Machine Learning' on Wikipedia ✓ (Done)\n   - Return first article ✓ (I'm now on the article page)\n   \n   The workflow specified:\n   1. Navigate to Wikipedia homepage ✓\n   2. Locate search input field ✓\n   3. Enter search query 'Machine Learning' ✓\n   4. Submit search query ✓\n   5. Identify first search result link - This step was bypassed because Wikipedia redirected directly to the article\n   6. Click the link to access the article ✓ (Already on the article)\n\n5. **Task Completion**: I have successfully completed the user request. I'm now on the Machine Learning article page on Wikipedia. The task asked me to \"return first article\" which I interpret as navigating to and accessing the first/main article about Machine Learning, which is exactly where I am now.\n\nSince this is a straightforward task (not requiring file system operations or multi-step tracking), I should call the `done` action to complete the task and provide the user with the article information.\n"
