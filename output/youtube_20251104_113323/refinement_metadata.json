The workflow context shows we are currently on the video page (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjmV0H1w7Hs), and the share modal is open. The agent needs to retry the process, which likely involves confirming the video opened successfully from the subscription feed and then proceeding to click the 'Share' button again (which is visible but the action failed previously due to output formatting, not UI interaction). Since the UI shows the share modal is *already open* and the error indicates an issue with the *model output format* from Step 5, the immediate next step should be to re-execute the sharing action properly, or confirm the link is copied if that was the intended action.",
      "reasoning": "The screenshot shows the agent is on the video page, not the subscriptions feed as described in the 'evaluation_previous_goal' (Step 4's verdict). Furthermore, the share modal is currently open, suggesting the 'Share' button was clicked successfully, but the subsequent action (likely extracting/copying the link) failed with a schema validation error in Step 5. Therefore, this screenshot is invalid for Step 5, which was supposed to be the action *resulting* in the error. The UI state suggests we are now *after* the failed Step 5 action, and the system is paused on the resulting screen (the opened share dialog on the video page).\n\nCrucially, the *context* states the previous goal was to click the video link from the subscriptions feed. The current URL confirms the agent *is* on the video page now, meaning the click succeeded, but the output validation failed. The goal of 'share the first video' implies we should now be focused on getting the link from this open modal. Since the model failed to output correctly, we should review the goal and the UI elements present to proceed correctly.",
