The browser state shows \"0.1 pages below\" which suggests there is content below the current viewport that I need to scroll to see.\n\n4. **Expected vs Actual**: After clicking search, I should see search results with Wikipedia links. The page stats show \"8 links\" which suggests results may have loaded, but they're not visible in the current interactive elements list shown above the fold.\n\n5. **Next Action**: I need to scroll down to see the search results. The page info shows \"0.1 pages below\" so I should scroll down to reveal the search results where I can find the Wikipedia link for Satyajit Ray.\n\n6. **Verdict on Previous Action**: The search was submitted successfully (URL changed to search results page), but I need to scroll to see the actual results.
