This indicates the task detail pane should be opening.\n\n2. **Current State Analysis**: \n   - The URL shows the Yoga task is selected (task/1211840427239169)\n   - In the browser state, I can see the Yoga task is highlighted with `id=highlightedCell` at index [2559]\n   - There are new interactive elements marked with asterisks (*):\n     - [2548] - \"Move tasks between sections\" button\n     - [2550] - \"Details\" button\n     - [2645] and [2649] - New divs that appeared\n   - The task row shows various interactive elements including a checkbox to mark complete, task name field, and action buttons\n\n3. **Looking for Delete Option**: In Asana, the delete option is typically found in:\n   - A three-dot menu (more actions) in the task detail pane\n   - Or in a menu accessible from the task row itself\n   \n   Looking at the visible elements, I can see:\n   - [2550] - \"Details\" button - this might open the full task detail pane\n   - [1832] - \"More actions\" button at the top of the page\n   - The task row itself has various buttons\n\n4. **Screenshot Analysis**: I should look at the screenshot to see if a task detail pane has opened on the right side of the screen. The screenshot would show me if there's a three-dot menu or delete button visible.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: Since I clicked on the Yoga task and the URL changed to show the task is selected, I need to:\n   - Check if a detail pane opened (visible in screenshot)\n   - Look for a three-dot menu or delete button in the task detail pane\n   - If no detail pane is visible, I might need to click the \"Details\" button [2550] to open it\n   - Or I could try right-clicking on the task or looking for a context menu\n\nLooking at the browser state more carefully, I notice there's a \"Details\" button [2550] that appeared after clicking the task. This suggests the full task detail pane might not be open yet. In Asana, clicking a task usually highlights it, but to see full details and access the delete option, you often need to click the \"Details\" button or double-click the task.\n\nLet me click on the \"Details\" button to open the full task detail pane where I should find the delete option.\n"
